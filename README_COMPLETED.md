What I did

- Created additional endpoints that were not included in the skeleton.
- Included some new libraries e.g. lombok & spring-boot-starter-test
- doBusiness methods
  - Sales department will find the average cost of booking per currency
  - Internal department will convert the date to human-readable date
- Testing is mainly done on the service class with unit test and E2E test using a spring boot integration test
  - The E2E test covers nearly all the code to  ensure it works as intended.
